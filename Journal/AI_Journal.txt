Week 1 
This week I tried to use Gemini for the first time but I am not a fan of it. 
I like to use chat gpt more because it is easier for me to get the information I need.
I did not have to use any AI to complete my assignments this week.
I want to try to use copilot next week, to see if it is similar to Chat and gemini.
